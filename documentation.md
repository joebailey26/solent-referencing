## Introduction

Through our research, we have discovered that Solent students are struggling with referencing in their assessments.

This project set out to create an application allowing students to paste in a website URL and get back a reference ready for use in their university assessment. The application goes one step further allowing users to create an account and manage their references in one place. The application is built using front-end technologies on a Jamstack architecture. The user interface is built using [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) whilst user authentication and persistant storage is managed with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). The application is hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and uses [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) to send data to Supabase.

### Methods

## Conclusion/Results

In order to properly analyse our solution, we sought real user feedback. A Google Form was used to collect quantitative data on the success of our solution. We tried very hard to ask non-biased questions and provoke thought among the respondents.

Looking forward, if the project were to continue, analytics could be placed within the application itself to generate real-world data. This data would tell us the what and how of users. To go one step further, we could harvest the emails used to generate logins and send a mailer with a more qualititave survey. This will get us data on how users feel about the application and whether it is actually improving their ability to reference. We may also get feedback on needed features, which we could then implement.
