## Introduction

Through our research, we have discovered that Solent students are struggling with referencing in their assessments.

This project set out to create an application allowing students to paste in a website URL and get back a reference ready for use in their university assessment. The application goes one step further allowing users to create an account and manage their references in one place. The application is built using front-end technologies on a Jamstack architecture. The user interface is built using [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) whilst user authentication and persistant storage is managed with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). The application is hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and uses [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) to send data to Supabase.
